# myclub
Application that will give a status on an HUD to DJ during performance indicating which genre of music to play next based off of 
audience preference. Audience data will be gathered by sound cloud playlists synced to mobile app or by survey integrated with mobile 
app before entry of club to determine which genre of music each particular person prefers. 
Once the application has the data required it will determine which genres should be played next based off of majority preference.  
This solution will also be integrated with proximity sensing hardware of sorts to keep track when people enter or leave the club.
